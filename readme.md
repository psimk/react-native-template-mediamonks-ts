# React Native Template MediaMonks

A React Native template designed to quick start projects.
 
## Features
- Unit Testing with jest and enzyme.
- e2e Testing using detox.
- Make your code pretty with prettier.
- Control your commits with eslinter and husky.
- Redux integration and ready to go using asynchronous actions with redux-thunk.


##  Getting Started

### Pre-requisites:
Make sure you have the react-native CLI installed.
```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

### Installation:
- Now using the react-native CLI you can make use of the template command specifying this project.
 
```
react-native init <Project Name> --template mediamonks
```
- The react-native template command creates a new package.json file which means we need to run a script to add the additional scripts, detox and lint-staging to the package.json.
```
node scripts/install.js
```

## Issues

### Detox

#### iOS

Make sure if you want to make use of detox to follow the [getting started](https://github.com/wix/detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.GettingStarted.md) and install the prerequisites and dependencies needed.
#### Android

Currently doesn't work out of the box, so there is a little set up needed in the android project itself. So you will need to follow a seperate [getting started](https://github.com/wix/detox/blob/master/docs/Introduction.Android.md) guide in order to setup detox for android.

Make sure to amend the configurations of the detox config appropriately to match the correct emulator you've selected.
